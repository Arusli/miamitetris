To re-webpack/update the main.js file, use: npm run-script build.

You need to link the index.html script tag to main.js or index.js, depending on if you're in production or development.

If you want to make the static version (no server), need to change the filepath to the js file in index.html, and change filpath to the palmtree image in the style.css.
